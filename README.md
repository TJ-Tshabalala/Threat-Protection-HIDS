## Inspiration

What inspired the creation of the tool:
- South Africa is the most targeted country in Africa, when it comes to [infostealer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infostealer) and [ransomware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ransomware).
- South Africa accounts for 40% ransomware attacks and just under 35% of infostealer incidents to occur on the continent.
- South Africa is ranked in the __top 10__ for most targeted region for attakcs globally and ranked as one of the lowest in the top 10 for **cybersecurity education** and **prepardness**.

- It is also noted that **60%** pf breaches occured in 2024, had "_a nonmalicious human error_", basically a simple human error.

## Where we see an opportunity and come in.

Notice the trend of employees not knowing/adhering to company policy, on the company workstations. This opens organizations to threats/ransomware/etc, be it from phishing emails, unauthorised installation of applications that are not company regulated/approved.
